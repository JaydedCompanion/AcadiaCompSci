But who’s watching?
There was a guy named Telesphore
You’re wonderful at reading files
I thought it was the oldest trick in the book
And then I ate the bowl
You may be ready to do the COMP 1113 assignment
There’s a purple bag of Crispers (tm)
And without toes, feet think about oranges
Just keep coding and you’ll be great at this in no time
People think writing silly sentences is fun, but it's true
Do you itch a scratch, or scratch an itch or itch and itch
Be sure to give all the credit to your lab instructor
Sleep helps keep the light away
Try phoning an aunt when you see an ant, she won’t care
Just joking, you worked hard to see this coherent story
I wouldn’t know what I don’t know if this is reality
If your suitcase is a 1/2 inch longer than the allowed size, will they let you carry it on?
You made it all the way to the end, that's awesome
