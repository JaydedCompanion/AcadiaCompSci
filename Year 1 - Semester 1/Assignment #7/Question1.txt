Compose a sentence that no one ever said by combining words from other sounds into a grammatically correct new sound. Write a function named audio-Sentence to generate a sentence out of individual words. Use at least three words in your sentence. You can use the words in the mediasource folder from the Web site or record your own words. Be sure to include a tenth (1/10) of a second pause between the words (Hint 1: Remember that zeroes for the sample values generate silence. Hint 2: Remember that the sampling rate is the number of samples per second. From there, you should be able to figure out how many samples need to be made to zero to generate a tenth of a second of silence.) Be sure to access your sounds in your Media Folder using getMediaPath so that it will work for users of your program as long as they first execute setMediaPath.
